# Cost Analysis

## Overview

This template is designed for cost-effective Kubernetes deployments with environment-specific optimizations.

## Environment Costs

### Development Environment
- **Node Type**: g6-standard-1 (1 vCPU, 2GB RAM)
- **Count**: 1 node (autoscaling 1-3)
- **Storage**: Ephemeral (no persistent volumes)
- **Monitoring**: Basic stack without persistence
- **Monthly**: ~$25-75 (depends on usage)

### Production Environment  
- **Node Type**: g6-standard-2 (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
- **Count**: 3 nodes (autoscaling 2-10)
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes for monitoring
- **Monitoring**: Full stack with data retention
- **Monthly**: ~$110-360 (depends on usage)

## Cost Optimization

### Development
- Use ephemeral storage
- Disable unnecessary monitoring components
- Set short data retention periods
- Scale down when not in use

### Production
- Right-size instances based on workload
- Use persistent storage judiciously
- Monitor resource utilization
- Implement pod resource limits

## Monitoring Costs

### Storage Impact
- **Prometheus**: 5-50GB depending on retention
- **Grafana**: 1-5GB for dashboards and config
- **Logs**: Variable based on application verbosity

### Optimization
- Configure appropriate retention policies
- Use storage classes with different performance tiers
- Monitor actual usage patterns
- Archive old metrics data

## Regional Considerations

Different Linode regions may have varying costs. Consider:
- Proximity to users
- Data transfer costs
- Regional pricing differences
- Compliance requirements
